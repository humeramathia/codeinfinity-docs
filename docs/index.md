#Dear Developer,

## Welcome to Humeras guide to deploying your iOS application to TestFlight using RAD Studio

## Introduction
This guide will show you how to deploy your iOS application to TestFlight using RAD Studio. TestFlight is a platform provided by Apple that allows you to distribute your application to a group of testers before releasing it to the App Store. This is a great way to get feedback on your application and make sure it is working correctly before releasing it to the public.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy your application to TestFlight, you will need the following:

1. **Apple Developer Account:** Ensure you are enrolled in the Apple Developer Program.
2. **TestFlight Installed:** Make sure the TestFlight app is installed on the device you intend to use for testing.
