## The .ipa File
The .ipa file is the compiled application that can be uploaded to TestFlight for distribution. This file is generated by RAD Studio during the deployment process and is stored in the output folder of your project. You will need this file to upload your application to TestFlight. It is typically found in the Bin/iOSDevice/Release folder of your project directory.

- Copy the .ipa file to your Mac for uploading to TestFlight.
- Download an app called Transporter from the App Store on your Mac. This is a tool provided by Apple for uploading apps to the App Store and TestFlight. Sign in with your Apple Developer account.
- Open Transporter and drag the .ipa file into the window. This will begin the upload process.
- Let it load and than click on the `Deliver` button. This will upload the app to TestFlight.
- Once the upload is complete, you will receive a confirmation email from Apple. Your app is now ready for testing on TestFlight.
