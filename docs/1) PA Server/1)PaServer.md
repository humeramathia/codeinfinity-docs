2.	**Transfer to Mac:** Copy the PA Server installation ZIP file to your Mac.
3.	**Install on Mac:** Unzip the file on your Mac and run the PA Server installer. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## B. Configure PA Server
1.	**Run PA Server:** Launch the PA Server application from the Applications folder or from where it was installed.
